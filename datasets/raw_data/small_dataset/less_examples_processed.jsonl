These types of messages were often used to promote mobile ringtones and subscription services, usually targeting teenagers and young adults.\n\n**A few things to keep in mind:**\n\n- **Subscription Trap:** Many of these services would sign users up for recurring weekly charges, often without them realizing the full cost.\n- **Premium SMS:** Sending a text to a short code (like 88888) would often result in premium charges on your phone bill.\n- **Age Restriction:** The \"16+ only\" is a legal disclaimer, but enforcement was often lax.\n- **T&Cs:** Always read the terms and conditions carefully before subscribing to any service.\n\n**If you receive a message like this today:**\n- It could be a scam or an attempt to get you to sign up for unwanted charges.\n- Do not reply or send any texts to the number provided.\n- If you are concerned about charges, contact your mobile provider.\n\n**Nostalgia Note:** The Crazy Frog ringtone became a cultural phenomenon and is remembered by many as a symbol of early mobile phone culture.\n\nIf you have any questions about mobile subscriptions, scams, or want to know more about Crazy Frog, let me know!\""}]}

If you meant something deeper or want to talk about relationships, let me know!\""}]}
